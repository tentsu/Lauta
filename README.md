# Lauta

## Description

**N**ode.js + **A**ngularJS + **M**ongoDB + **R**eact

Simple image board to experiment with some technologies (*krhm*react*krhm*).

This project also works as my place to really learn gitting right, e.g. clear commits with one task etc.
But hey, I still love "Fixed things." commits. :P


## TODO

* Image upload when creating new thread
* Image upload when adding post to thread
* When specific thread opened, client pulls new posts every 5 sec or so
* Parsing posts' date
* Save author somehow
* If no title, show beginning of the post as title
* Anchor links to posts
* Styling. Yes, very much styling.
