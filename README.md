# Lauta

## Description

**N**ode.js + **A**ngularJS + **M**ongoDB + **R**eact

Simple image board to experiment with some technologies (*krhm*react*krhm*).

This project also works as my place to really learn gitting right, e.g. clear commits with one task etc.
But hey, I still love "Fixed things." commits. :P
